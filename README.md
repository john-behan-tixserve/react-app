# Interview Task - React App

This is a simple React app.

1. Move the `header` and `footer` elements into their own components and use in the `App` component.
2. Create an `UpdateName` component and use it to update the name value.
3. Change the footer date string to use JS to render the current year.
4. Pin the footer to the bottom. Make the main element take up any extra vertical space available.
5. Bonus - Create a `DogFact` component and use it to display a random dog fact on app load
  - This is the endpoint `https://dog-api.kinduff.com/api/facts`
6. Create a branch and open a PR to the repo
